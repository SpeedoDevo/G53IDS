        The aim of the game is to build the best possible bridge that can take a van to the other side of the gap.
        To do this you can click and drag to draw a line. <strong>Lines should not intersect.</strong>
        If you want the van to pass over that line, draw while you are holding Ctrl. You should aim to connect the
        lines on their ends (black dots) as this makes the best connection. If you've made a mistake, you can undo it
        using the
        <md-icon md-font-set="material-icons" class="inline-icon">undo</md-icon>
        button (or redo it using the
        <md-icon md-font-set="material-icons" class="inline-icon">redo</md-icon>
        button) or you can click on it while holding Alt to delete it. You can also clear the complete bridge and start
        from scratch using the
        <md-icon md-font-set="material-icons" class="inline-icon">delete_forever</md-icon>
        button.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you are happy with your creation you can press the
        <md-icon md-font-set="material-icons" class="inline-icon">play_arrow</md-icon>
        button to spawn a van that will try to pass though it. While the simulation is running you'll be able to see
        how much more load the bridge can carry before breaking. When this hits 100% that means that the bridge is
        broken
        somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you like the bridge that you created, but you want to try something new you can save your bridge by clicking
        on the 'NEW' button next to SAVES. Then you can name it using the field on the top of the new card and if you
        are
        happy with the bridge you can click on the
        <md-icon md-font-set="material-icons" class="inline-icon">check</md-icon>
        button to save it, or the
        <md-icon md-font-set="material-icons" class="inline-icon">close</md-icon>
        button to discard it. If you want to use a save (or one of the samples) you can click on 'LOAD' that will put
        the saved bridge in the editor. If you don't need a save anymore you can click the
        <md-icon md-font-set="material-icons" class="inline-icon">delete</md-icon>
        button to free up some space.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also adjust the simulation by using the sliders on the side. For example you could make the gravitation
        weaker to cheat a little, or you can increase the van's weight to stress test your bridge. You can also increase
        or decrease the elevation and distance between the two sides, to make the problem a bit more interesting.
