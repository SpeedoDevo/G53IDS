* Grade: 78 / 100
* Comments:
> The student has implemented an evolutionary algorithm for optimising bridge designs using a physics simulator. The optimisation process and the bridge designs are visualised using a range of web technologies.  
> The student demonstrates a thorough understanding of the practical and conceptual issues involved. The report gives a very good account of related work, including similar applications of evolutionary algorithms, as well as an insightful discussion of relevant web frameworks.  
> The project is challenging, as it not only involves several web technologies, but also a non-trivial application domain for evolutionary algorithms.  
> The report contains a detailed specification, including functional and non-functional requirements. The system is thoroughly evaluated according to these requirements.  
> The dissertation is clearly structured, the quality of the analysis is excellent. The student is capable of reflecting upon the implications of his own design decisions.  
> In overall, this is an outstanding project. The student has worked independently with minimal technical assistance from the supervisor, and developed a technically sophisticated, and visually impressive web application that meets almost all of the requirements. Some more evaluation would be required for the project to be publishable.
